# Reddit-Video-Generator
This App creates video from reddit posts. 
The bot leverages the Reddit API to fetch a random thread along with its comments from a specified subreddit. Subsequently, it converts both the thread's title and comments into speech, saving the resulting audio for future use. Additionally, it employs Playwright to capture screenshots of the comments and stores them as PNG files. The bot further enhances its content by downloading a random clip from a Minecraft video. Lastly, it ingeniously merges the audio and screenshots, seamlessly compiling them into a video through the use of FFmpeg.
